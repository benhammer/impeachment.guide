		        <p>An <b>impeachment inquiry</b> is a process to determine whether the House of Representatives will vote on impeachment and on what grounds. If the inquiry leads to a vote on impeachment in which a majority of representatives vote yes, then the president is impeached, which means the matter is referred to the Senate for a trial. In the Senate, if 2/3<sup>rds</sup> of senators also vote yes, then president would be removed from office.</p>

            <p><span class="header">Key Documents Released</span> On <b>Sept. 25, 2019</b>, the White House released a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/25/us/politics/trump-ukraine-transcript.html">summary of the Trump-Zelenskyy call</a>. After the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/sres325">Senate</a> and <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/116-2019/h548">House</a> voted unanimously on Sept. 24-25, 2019 on non-binding resolutions demanding access to the <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6430388/20190812-Whistleblower-Complaint-Unclass.pdf">whistleblower complaint</a>, and minutes before the Director of National Intelligence&rsquo;s Sept. 26, 2019 <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?464509-1/acting-director-national-intelligence-maguire-testifies-whistleblower-complaint">appearance</a> before the House Intelligence Commitee, the White House made the complaint available to Congress, which then made it available to the public.</p>

		        <p><span class="header">Inquiry Opened</span> In September 2019, it became known that a government employee filed a whistleblower complaint documenting that on July 25, 2019, President Trump urged Ukraine president Volodymr Zelenskyy to investigate alleged actions by presidential candidate Joe Biden, Trump&rsquo;s chief 2020 election rival at the time. The President also asked Ukraine to locate the Democratic National Committee&rsquo;s 2016 email server (which was hacked by Russia in an effort to help the President win the 2016 election), and to do both investigations in collaboration with the President&rsquo;s personal lawyer. On <b>Sept. 24, 2019</b>, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced an inquiry into the impeachment of President Donald Trump would begin.</p>

        <h1>
          Possible Charges
        </h1>

        <p style="margin: 2em 0;">The House may consider impeachment charges based several sets of facts and theories:</p>

        <p><span class="header">Foreign Assistance in the Election</span> The White House has said that in a July 25, 2019 phone call, President Trump asked Ukraine president Volodymr Zelenskyy for a “favor” to investigate the President’s chief political opponent and to locate the Democratic National Committee (DNC)’s 2016 email server. The President asked Zelenskyy to coordinate the investigations with the President’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Although framed as an official investigation into corruption, the focus on the President’s political opponents and the involvement of the President’s personal lawyer suggest the President’s intent was political. Foreign entities are prohibited by law from making contributions to political campaigns, including by providing favors of material value, and an impeachment charge could be based on a violation of law or perceived norms for foreign interference in elections.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Extortion or Quid Pro Quo</span> One of the President’s foreign policy goals has been to get European countries to step up their support for military security, rather than relying on the United States. According to the White House, in the July 25, 2019 Trump-Zelenskyy phone call, the President told Zelenskyy that he thought the United States’s security aid to Ukraine made the nations’ relationship not “reciprocal,” and then in his next sentence asked Zelenskyy for the “favor” described above. Although not stated in clear words, the President and Zelenskyy likely understood the President as asking Ukraine to make the relationship reciprocal by performing the favor. Zelenskyy may also have known, although it was not discussed on the call, that shortly before the call, the President had halted that security aid. Providing aid in exchange for an investigation would be a quid pro quo, and withholding aid to coerce Ukraine to perform an investigation would be extortion &mdash; both of which are generally accepted tools in foreign policy and well within the President’s foreign policy powers.</p>

        <p><span class="header">Mishandling Records</span> The whistleblower complaint alleges that the verbatim transcript of the July 25, 2019 Trump-Zelenskyy phone call and other politically sensitive documents were purposefully misfiled in a location meant for classified materials, even though the call and the other documents did not involve classified information, in order to restrict access to the documents. Several laws including the President Records Act require presidential records like the verbatim transcript to be preserved but may not require that the records be stored in any particular electronic system. (What has often been described as the publicc transcript of the call is actually a summary of the call produced by the White House &mdash; it is not known whether the White House accurately summarized the verbatim transcript.)</p>

        <p><span class="header">Emoluments</span> According to the White House, in the July 25, 2019 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine president Volodymr Zelenskyy, Zelenskyy said he had stayed at the President’s Trump Tower property on his last visit to the United States, among other thanks and praise, to which the President responded positively.  Since the President personally benefits from business at his properties, foreign leaders’ stays at his properties may be a constitutionally prohibited emolument.</p>
